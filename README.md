# single-cell-rnaseq-analysis

This repository contains a modular, research-grade workflow for analyzing
single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data.

The pipeline reflects real analytical practices used in biological research
and is designed to prioritize:

- biological interpretability
- statistical rigor
- reproducibility
- clean, readable code

The workflows are intentionally written as scripts rather than a monolithic
package, making the logic transparent and easy to adapt to new datasets.

## 🔬 Scope of the repository

This repository covers the full snRNA-seq analysis lifecycle:

- quality control and filtering
- doublet handling and ambient RNA considerations
- normalization and batch correction
- clustering and annotation
- cell-type–specific subclustering
- pseudobulk differential expression
- pathway enrichment
- cell-type composition analysis
- visualization utilities
- optional latent-space modeling with scVI

Raw sequencing data are **not included**.

## 🧬 Analysis philosophy

### Why pseudobulk?
Differential expression is performed using pseudobulk aggregation to respect
biological replication and avoid statistical pitfalls associated with
single-cell-level testing.

### Why cell-type–specific subclustering?
Broad clustering can mask meaningful heterogeneity, particularly in highly
abundant cell types such as hepatocytes. Subclustering enables resolution of
zonation, stress responses, and disease-associated programs.

### Why scVI?
scVI is included as an **optional exploratory module** to validate transcriptional
structure in a probabilistic latent space. It is not used for annotation or
differential expression.

## ♻️ Reproducibility notes

- Scripts are designed to be run sequentially
- Parameters (QC thresholds, clustering resolution) are dataset-dependent
- Manual biological interpretation is required for annotation steps
- Outputs are saved at each stage to support inspection and reuse
